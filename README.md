# Customer-Flight-Satisfaction-Prediction

-   Identifying weather a Passenger is  **Satisfied**  or  **Unsatisfied**  based on the flight travel history. This problem is a  **classification Problem**.
    
-   Machine Learning algorithms I have applied for this project are   **Logistic Regression**,  **Decision Tree**  and  **Random Forest**.

- The dataset consist of information of passengers boarding and deboarding information and the services provided during the travel in the flight.

## Conclusion

-   Studied  **in-depth**  about the various  **features**  in the data, their  **characteristics**  and their  **distributions**.

-   Went through an  **extensive**  and  **thorough**  data analysis process, exploring various relationships between the different  **features**.
    
-   **Encoded**  the  _categorical data_  and  **removed**  any  _redundant columns_  to make our dataset fit for training.
    
-   Tested different models, performed  **cross-validation**  on them, and compared their performance.
